This is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js project) that I built to try out this stack. To test it, first run the [backend](https://github.com/ogKamy/mern-todo-app-backend), then follow these instructions in the project directory:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Make sure the database is running on [MongoDB Atlas] https://cloud.mongodb.com
